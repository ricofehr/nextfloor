# enginepp

A 3d engine at very early stage and in working progress.
(C++ version of https://github.com/ricofehr/engine, with improved features)

The program generates 4 rooms with some bricks created and moved randomly,
The camera can move with mouse (head orientation) and arrow keys (camera direction).

## Prerequisites

Needs Cmake, OpenGL3 (>3.3) and GLew / GLM / SOIL / Glfw libraries.

On ubuntu or Debian, apt-get make full prerequisites install
```
apt-get install cmake make g++ libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxext-dev libglfw3-dev libsoil-dev libglm-dev libglew-dev
```

On OSX, we need XCode and install some libraries with brew (SOIL must be install manually)
```
brew install cmake glm glew glfw3
```

And SOIL must be install manually
```
$ git clone https://github.com/smibarber/libSOIL
$ cd libSOIL && make
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/include/SOIL
$ sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include/SOIL/
$ sudo cp libSOIL.* /usr/local/lib/
```

## Compile

```
$ cmake .

## Features

- C++11
- Opengl 3
- Use of Glew, GLM, SOIL, Glfw libraries
- CMake for compile

## Folders
```
+--src/ 	Sources
+--bin/		Binary folder where engine executable is written
+--assets/      Texture files
+--demos/	Demo gif animated files
```

## Run

Use mouse for head orientation and arrow keys for camera move.
When we cross a door, we change room (4 rooms).

```
bin/./engine
```
![Engine](demos/enginepp.gif?raw=true)

## Todo

- Improve collision algorithm
- Manage shadows and lights
- Improve camera move and interactions
- Manage drawing of more 3d models
